**Shrinkage limit:**
The shrinkage limit (SL) is the water content where further loss of moisture will not result in any more volume reduction. The shrinkage limit is much less commonly used than the liquid limit and the plastic limit.

**Plastic limit:**
The plastic limit (PL) is the water content where soil starts to exhibit plastic behavior. A thread of soil is at its plastic limit when it is rolled to a diameter of 3 mm or begins to crumble. To improve consistency, a 3 mm diameter rod is often used to gauge the thickness of the thread when conducting the test. (AKA Soil Snake Test).

**Liquid limit:**
‚Liquid limit‚(LL or w_L ) is defined as the arbitrary limit of water content at which the soil is just about to pass from the plastic state into the liquid state. At this limit, the soil possesses a small value of shear strength, losing its ability to flow as a liquid.In other words, the liquid limit is the minimum moisture content at which the soil tends to flow as a liquid.
