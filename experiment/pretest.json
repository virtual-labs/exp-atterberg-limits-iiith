		{
			"question": "2. The ratio of liquid limit, minus the natural water content to the plasticity index of the soil is ____.",
			"answers": {
				"a": "Consistency index",
				"b": "Plasticity index",
				"c": "All of the above",
				"d": "None of the above"
			},
			"explanations": {
				"a": "Liquid limit and plasticity index represent the state of soil that begins to behave like a liquid and as a plastic state respectively. The state between liquid limit and plastic limit represents the firmness of the soil.",

			"question": "3. The laboratory test results of a soil sample are given below: Percentage finer than 4.75 mm = 60%, Percentage finer than 0.075 mm = 30%, Liquid Limit = 35%, Plastic Limit = 27%. The soil classification is ____.",
			"answers": {
				"a": "GM (Gravel-Silt)",
				"b": "SM (Silty Sand)",
				"c": "GC (Clayey Gravel)",
				"d": "ML-MI (Low Compressible Silt - Intermediate Compressible Silt)"
			},
			"explanations": {
				"a": "",
				"b": "Plasticity Index = LL-PL = 8%. Fine grained soils are those having 50% or more pass through 75 sieve (0.075 mm). It is designated as sand (S) if 50% or more pass through 4.75 mm sieve otherwise designated as gravel (G). Since the percentage finer than 4.75 mm is 60%, it is designated as sand (S). Further, percentage finer than 75 is 30 which is more than 12%, observe the liquid limit and plastic limit on the plasticity chart. Plasticity index corresponding to A-line, The point corresponding to and lies below A- line on the Plasticity chart. It is designated as M or O. Therefore, the soil is classified as SM.",
